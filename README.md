# WakeVsNremModel
Model for the classification of LFP data in mice to determine WAKE vs NREM states. Created for BME_4540: Neural Models and Machine Learning, taught by Dr. Satish Nair at the University of Missouri, Columbia

This is the first neural model that I have written. It trains on one mouse with 97 trials fairly evenly split between NREM and WAKE. The model accuracy averages around 96.8% in its binary classification.
